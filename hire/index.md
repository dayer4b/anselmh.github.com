Hi, I'm Anselm.<br>
I specialize in writing and architecting scalable front-end code for websites. With a strong **focus on performance**, **simplicity** and **maintainability**, I build front-ends that will just work best for your project. Learn more [about me](/about/), my expectations from you as a [client](/about/#matchmyinterest) or [recruiter](/about/#recruiters) or take a look at [my CV](/cv/).

I am open for new adventures and projects involving front-end work. I love to hear your story &mdash; just get in touch with me and we'll see if we can work something out. :)

## Availability

I am currently accepting new projects starting **Mid November, 2013**.
