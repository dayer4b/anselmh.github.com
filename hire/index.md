## Hello, I’m Anselm.

I write code for scalable and maintainable front-end projects. **Code climate**, **quality** and reaching **performance goals** is the key focus in my work. Creating **cross-device responsive experiences** and **testing code** on a variety of devices is where I am specialized in. And if you need an **automated, tool-driven setup** (for example with Grunt), I can surely help you out.

Learn more [about me](/about/), my expectations from you as a [client](/about/#matchmyinterest) or [recruiter](/about/#recruiters) or take a look at [my CV](/cv/) and [my work](/work/).

Regardless if you want me to join your team for a project, want me to give a workshop, talk or just want to meet me—be sure to contact me.

## Availability

I am currently accepting new projects starting **September, 2014**.
