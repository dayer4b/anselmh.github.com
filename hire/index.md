## Hey, I’m Anselm.

I write code for scalable and maintainable front-end projects. **Code climate**, **quality** and reaching **performance goals** is the key focus in my work. Creating **cross-device responsive experiences** and **testing code** on a variety of devices is where I am specialized in. And if you need an **automated, tool-driven setup** (for example with Grunt), I can set this up for you.

Learn more [about me](/about/), my expectations from you as a [client](/about/#matchmyinterest) or [recruiter](/about/#recruiters) or take a look at [my CV](/cv/) and [my work](/work/).

Regardless if you want me to join your team for a project, want me to give a workshop, talk or just want to meet me—be sure to contact me.

## Availability

I am currently accepting new projects starting **October, 2014**.

## For inquiries please consider:

- Both, me and you probably want to have a good product when you hire me. The groundwork for this is a proper, realistic timeframe and project management. Nothing is worse than a project with countless revisions and changes not being finished, mostly for your customer. If you need help with project management or methodology how to plan your project, I’m happy to help you out or point you to the right person.

- Plan ahead. Projects can only be well crafted with a proper timeframe. To do my work the project’s goal, a concept and at least a rough design (if not also required) and technical setup should be already defined and set. If you need help or don’t know what you need to do, please contact me in advance so we can figure this out before starting the project.

## Dear Recruiters,

I am always open for a new work experience but be sure it really fits to me and it is properly paid.
I expect you to read my [CV](/cv/) and have a look at [my projects](/work/).

With that in mind, I will be happy to speak with you about possibilities. Thank you! :)
