## About me

![Profile picture of Anselm Hannemann](http://img.anselmhannemann.netdna-cdn.com/img/anselm_btconf2013.jpg)
I am a 24 year old frontend developer from lovely Munich, Germany currently living also in Colgone and work as a freelancer.

## What I do

You can hire me for the following list of work:

- **Frontend development** (HTML5, CSS, JavaScript). If you want a high-performance, modern and nice project, I am happy to discuss the project with you.
- **Code Reviews**. I review your existing code and give you advice how to improve it. Usually this will take about ~1-2 days.
- **Device Testing**. I test, debug and review each project on a mass of devices in one of our device labs. This also correlates with my open source project [opendevicelab.com](http://opendevicelab.com/)
- **Digital Magazines** (Concept, research, development of the full app) on basis of web-technologies or similar techniques.
- [**Speaking** about Frontend development](/conf/).
- **Workshops** about Frontend development.
- **Writing** technical articles.

## Please consider:

- I am working on your budget. I try to do my best to fit in your demands but please be aware that I cannot do countless revisions, changes on your project. It would burst the timeframe of the project and the budget.

- Consider a proper timeframe that is doable for you and me. If I don't have the data in time, I might have to drop the project or drop the project during development and send you an invoice for the work I've done until that.

## Dear Recruiters,

I am always open for a new work experience but be sure it really fits to me and it is properly paid.
I expect recruiters to read my [CV](/cv/), look at [my projects](/work/) and consider the employer has no problem with me not having a post-graduate but over 6 years working in my job already with much experience.

With that in mind, I will be happy to speak with you about possibilities. Thank you! :)
