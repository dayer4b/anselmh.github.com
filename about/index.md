You can hire me for the following list of work:

- **Front-end development** (HTML5, CSS, JavaScript). If you want a performance optimized, well coded and modern project, I am happy to do it. This can be a cool, small one pager but also a large-scale web application.
- **Website Audits**. I do performance and code quality audits and check if your code works fine in most cases.
- **Code Reviews**. I do code quality reviews of existing code and give advice on how to improve it.
- **Device Testing**. I test, debug and review each project on a mass of devices in one of our device labs. This also correlates with my open source project [opendevicelab.com](http://opendevicelab.com/)
- [**Speaking** about front end development](/conf/).
- **Workshops** about front end development.
- **Writing** technical articles.
- Working agile: I know Scrum, Kanban and have worked in several projects and teams using it.

I have specific knowledge on:

- Git
- HTML
- CSS / Sass
- JavaScript / jQuery
- Front-End Tooling with npm / bower, Grunt / Gulp, and more.
- Working Agile with Scrum or Kanban
- W3C / WHATWG Webstandards (Following, Improving, Developing, Writing)
