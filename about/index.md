## About me

![Profile picture of Anselm Hannemann](http://img.anselmhannemann.netdna-cdn.com/img/anselm_btconf2013.jpg)
Iâ€™m a 24 years old front-end stack developer from Munich, Germany and currently also live in Cologne. I work as a freelancer for companies and agencies and was nominated and short-listed as [Young Developer of the Year 2014](https://thenetawards.com/vote/young-developer/anselm-hannemann/). I am an active Open Source contributor, have held several conference talks and am author of articles for Smashing Magazine, Creative Bloq (netmagazine) and other well known sites.

You can hire me for the following list of work:

- **Front-end development** (HTML5, CSS, JavaScript). If you want a performance optimized, well coded and modern project, I am happy to discuss it with you. This can be a cool, small one pager but also a large-scale web application.
- **Code Reviews**. I can do a code quality review of your existing code and give you advice how to improve it.
- **Device Testing**. I test, debug and review each project on a mass of devices in one of our device labs. This also correlates with my open source project [opendevicelab.com](http://opendevicelab.com/)
- [**Speaking** about front end development](/conf/).
- **Workshops** about front end development.
- **Writing** technical articles.
- Working agile: I know Scrum, Kanban and have worked in several projects and teams using it.
