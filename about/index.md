## About me

![Profile picture of Anselm Hannemann](/img/anselmhannemann.jpg)
I am a 23 year old frontend developer from the lovely Munich, Germany and work as a freelancer. You can hire me but _be sure [I match your interest]()_.
Also _make sure you are asking for a proper time frame_. I won't take any development project that has to be finished within the next two weeks. [Find out why]().

## What I do

If you hire me, you will get either of the following work from me:

- **Frontend development** (HTML5, CSS, JavaScript). If you want a high-performance, modern and nice project, I am happy to discuss the project with you.
- **Digital Magazines** (Concept, research, development of the full app) on basis of web-technologies or similar techniques.
- **Speaking** about Frontend development.
- **Workshops** about Frontend development.
- **Writing** technical articles.

## What I do not do:

- **no Backend stuff is served** although I can recommend you people doing that for you properly
- **Countless revisions and changes in a project**. I expect that you have a proper concept, time frame, one final revision. This avoids high invoices and bad mood on both sides. _I you can't provide that and won't let me do the concept, too, I might be the wrong person to hire._
- If you need to rely on very old browsers and want to include stuff like Flash, I clearly am the wrong person to hire.

## What to consider:

- My **pricing** is not very cheap on an hourly basis. As I provide **high quality work** and am working very fast, expect my hourly rates to be higher than you usually might expect.

- If you don't know how to make a responsive and flexible concept and design I won't be the right person to develop your layout as code.

- Consider a proper timeframe that is doable for you and me. If I don't have the data in time, I might have to drop the project or drop the project during development and send you an invoice for the work I've done until that.

## Recruiters

This is simple: I am always open for a new work experience but be sure it really fits to me and it is properly paid.
I expect recruiters to read my [CV](), look at [my projects]() and consider the employer has no problem with me not having a post-graduate but 6 years working in my job already with much experience.

With that in mind, I will be happy to speak with you about possibilities. But don't expect me to reply if you are not aware of the point above. Thank you! :)
