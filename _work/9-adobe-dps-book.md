Together with <a href="https://twitter.com/richardbrammer">Richard Brammer</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/FischaelaMeer">Michaela Lehr</a> from Berlin I wrote my first book, published in 2013. It has been published at the dpunkt Verlag and is available only in German.

I wrote chapter six and seven which mainly are about using web technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the Adobe Digital Publishing Suite to extend its functionality and be more flexible. You could also say itâ€™s a beginnner guide to these web languages in two chapters, including how to use Adobe Edge Animate as assistance to build web based animations.
