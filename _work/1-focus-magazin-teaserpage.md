For the German weekly News magazine FOCUS Magazin I created a [teaser website](http://media.focus-magazin.de/) for their digital products (Tablet App, Augmented Reality App, E-Paper and more). It is a plain HTML solution.

Due to performance issues and the lack of a responsive webdesign, the site has its very own layout compared to its [mothership](http://www.focus.de/). The teaser page runs on mobile devices, tablets and desktop sites smoothly due to a responsive layout that adapts to each screen.
That way the user gets a smooth and convenient experience visiting the apps and website.

In early 2015, the major changes coming to the brand itself were also reflected to the website and now the page shines in new brand colors and new style.

This is how the initial version build in 2013 looked like:
