This year I changed my way of doing vacation. I changed my way of life. Joy is the most desireable feeling of life, and when you get it, you are able to do great things. It does not matter if you are working or not, with joy you will do things better.

I almost stopped doing the typical kind of vacation, laying on the beach relaxing. I tend to get bored very quick relaxing. This year I made a lot of small 'vacations' &mdash; I just visited other countries and cities for a conference and appended 2-3 more days to explore the site. This is the perfect mix out of work and exploring when I don't do any outdoor sports (which is the other kind of vacation I do).

But as I am a freelancer I also need to do some tasks when I'm aborad. It would work doing nothing for a few times but being at around 15 conferences a year means you need to do some work during that days, too. Working in a hotel is usually pretty boring so I decided to work in a coffee shops or even on a tower. Would you believe I am very productive on such days? I am and I will explain why&hellip;

To be honest it is exhausting to travel a lot. You need to plan things, travel, will get irregular sleep and all that stuff. And you also need to care about where to stay, how to finance it, how to get internet and where to charge your devices. Yes, this can be a big problem.

### Sleep

I usually pick a good hotel for a one or two days and hostels or an apartment the other days. This means even if one of the locations is badly chosen you have no worry as you know it will be better in one or two days. While this also saves costs it has another advantage: Staying in cheaper hostels you easily get in contact with other people &mdash; and I met great people there.

### Mobile Data Plans

In some countries it is not very easy to get a data SIM card for your phone but I never failed so far. Italy and Switzerland need your Passport or ID as Germany want to have to give you a card while in Poland you just pay 10 bucks to get 1GB of data. Plans are very different but it is always cheaper than your foreign contract. With a data plan in your pocket you are now set to work wherever you are. This is fun and last week I even wrote this blog post on a tower in Bologna. Pretty cool having a view over the whole city while working and writing, isn't it?

### Power

The main problem I always have is battery power. My MacBook Air lasts usually for 3.5hrs now, including one recharge of my iPhone which has a pretty ridiculous last of battery when tethering. This is not very long, so take care to find a coffee shop or restaurant where you can recharge. Otherwise, you're lucky if you have chosen your hostel near the city center so you can simply go home and recharge there. In Italy I clearly prefer sitting in the sun enjoying an Espresso while charging my computer.

### Excerpt: Force yourself to just do it

- **Buy a conference ticket in another country**
This can be a good reason to travel to a new country and while you will learn something new at the conference while meeting new but maybe also known people what give you sort of security you can extend this journey by a few days traveling to other cities around.
- **Just book it**
I personally am not a person that decides very quickly. Honestly, I am the person who shifts decisions until it may be too late. But if you just force yourself to book immediately when you have the idea, just do it. It's easy – no one wants to spend money for nothing and now you will have to do that trip.
- **Take some friends with you**
Sometimes it is better to take some friends with you. This can be good friends but I recommend to do those travels with people that work in your industry but you don't know too much. People you met at conferences or even only know from twitter can (but surely aren't for sure)  be a good choice. Knowing someone is important and makes you feel more comfortable while traveling in an all new country.

I never experienced major trouble which I couldn't solve easily by myself. Of course bad things happen &mdash; on my last trip my charger broke and I needed to search half a day for an Apple Store because I had to finish some work on that day &mdash; what did I do? Bought it, walked up to a nice place over Florence and worked with this view in front of me:

This look pretty fantastic, doesn't it? To be honest, my trips aren't _that_ cool all the time. Sometimes it is just visiting a city for two days and it rains and rains. But to make my message short I give you one advice:

Wether you're just changing the location of your work in the same city or traveling to foreign countries – it all counts and all makes a difference. By being at foreign places you'll have new impressions, maybe even a foreign language or unknown culture. This is where our mind comes into place: When you see something new your brain thinks how to connect this to your known world. And that's where ideas develop.

It might be the wrong thing to travel if you need a project to be finished – it is actually hard to just work after a schedule being abroad. But if you need some inspiration or new ideas it might be the best idea to just leave your usual place to work.
