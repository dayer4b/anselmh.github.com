title: "Reading List #26"
---

**After another week not maintaining my list (I apologize!) <br>here are a bunch of new and interesting links.**

- **[Offline First](http://blog.joelambert.co.uk/2012/11/26/offline-first-a-better-html5-user-experience/)** shares some thoughts why you should decouple your webapp from the server and other online dependencies

- Again W3C, WHATWG and developers are in a fight about a new element. After picture it is now about the  **[&lt;main>-element](http://blog.adrianroselli.com/2012/11/new-main-element-approved-then-blocked.html)** a rather sad story for web standards as this element would improve accessibility

- Do you understand how srcset would work? Try the **[srcset sample parser by RICG](http://responsiveimagescg.github.com/picture-refimp/demo/)** to see what image would be chosen by the user agent

- tympanus again published a good article about how to **[learn principles to improve your CSS](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2012/11/20/learning-principles-for-improving-your-css/)**

- [Andre Jay Meissner](https://twitter.com/klick_ass) shared his thoughts on **[mobile device testing and OpenDeviceLabs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9uDIVo0RsQ&list=SP509C20F61AD025B3&feature=g-list)** in this video interview by t3n

- Second, he shared a really important quote by [Mat Marquis (@wilto)](https://twitter.com/wilto) at [beyondtellerand](http://2012.beyondtellerrand.com/) **["Best viewed in the 1st world"](https://twitter.com/klick_ass/status/270481479908331520)**

- The famous **OFFSCREEN Mag did a little X-Mas gift-list**. Great for inspiration but even better, if you tweet about it, they might choose you an buy you something of this gift-list. **[Read it here](http://www.offscreenmag.com/xmas/)**

- Peter-Paul Koch (PPK) wrote about another forgotten group: **[non-native speakers](http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2012/11/conference_dive_11.html)** &ndash; whilst many write about black-vs-white or men-women he shares some insights about non-native (mostly English) speakers

- But there might be some hope: Read this article on **[how to find unknown but great speakers](http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2012/11/20/the-front-end-summit-new-speaker-program/)**

- The workingdraft team was part of the beyondtellerand:web conference and recorded an **[interview with Bruce Lawson](http://workingdraft.de/97/)** by Opera about webstandards and Opera browser

- Finally I am **[searching for feedback on conference video coverage](http://anselm-hannemann.com/blog/2012/11/28/conference-coverage/)** and if it is good to share it for free. Please share and promote this link to make conferences better
