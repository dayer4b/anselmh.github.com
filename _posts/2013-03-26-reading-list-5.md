**Gosh, it has been some weeks already that I've published my last reading list. A new issue now.**


- **[Progressive Reduction](http://layervault.tumblr.com/post/42361566927/progressive-reduction)** is a nice UI technique focussing on reduction.

- **[Before you file an issue, please read this before](https://github.com/necolas/issue-guidelines/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)** I am really hoping this will be regarded more often.

- **[responsive-nav.js](https://github.com/viljamis/responsive-nav.js)** by Viljami Salminen  its an UX approach of offering a simple and good usable navigation on different devices. [Check the demo to get an idea](http://viljamis.com/responsive-nav/).

- Object Oriented JavaScript – **[What you need to know](http://javascriptissexy.com/oop-in-javascript-what-you-need-to-know/)**

- Say what you want about measuring FPS in Chrome but this is more important: **[Measure FPS on Chrome for Android](http://ariya.ofilabs.com/2013/03/frame-rate-hud-on-chrome-for-android.html)**. Why? Because it gives you a lot of insights on how your website renders on mobile browsers which are really different from Desktop ones.

- **['Suit'](https://github.com/necolas/suit/)** – a simple UI framework for modern browsers by Nicolas Gallagher.

- I held a talk about **Responsive Images** in Lille at [TakeOff Conference](http://takeoffconf.com/) in January. **[Here is the video on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPOeg5WAhgw)** and [my slides](http://slides.anselm-hannemann.com/respimg-takeoff/).
