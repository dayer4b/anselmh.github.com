title: "Why I removed the Social Media Buttons"
---

**There has been some discussion about social media buttons on websites. Because most of the buttons are crap by code-design and can break your website it is worth considering to remove them.**

As [Oliver Reichenstein by iA](http://informationarchitects.net/blog/sweep-the-sleaze/) wrote last week, it is not worth it embedding the social media buttons. Here is why I removed them now:

- I already removed Facebook Button several months ago because the servers by Facebook sometimes are really slow and actually affected my site's performance. After removing these lacks were eliminated.

- All these buttons rely on external servers which of I do never know they are online. And if they are not or have an overload your site will hold loading until this widget works.

- They are not worth it. The design is mostly ugly and the users often do not click the buttons at all.

- Users who share my blog posts actively do it anyways and the response might be bigger than with an predefined sharing-text.

And additionally the existing heise.de SocialButton script which loads images by default and executes the real code after the first click relies on jQuery which I don't really need here.
