Today I want to share an announcement with you: Finally, after months of work, **[INIT 1.0](http://use-init.com/) has been released today**.<br>
Founder of the project [Hans-Christian Reinl](http://drublic.de/) has written an announcement post at [The Nitty Gritty](http://thenittygritty.co/reducing-boilerplate-code-front-end-init) and I am happy to be co-author of the project.

## What is INIT?

INIT is based upon HTML5 Boilerplate and adds more structure for SCSS files, JavaScripts, includes build tasks and a whole lot more.
