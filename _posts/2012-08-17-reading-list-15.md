**New things arrived the web. This linklist is mostly about them.**

- [Medium.com](https://medium.com/) is a writing platform founded by the founder of twitter. He thinks it is time for a social writing network. Some say it's a clone of tumblr, some say, it's a big new thing. For me, it looks nice ;)

- [Branch.com](http://branch.com/) is another new service about networking. It is made for talking about specific links / topics, generating a discussion which you can finally share or embed into your blog.

- Adobe Edge [preview 6.1](http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/edge/) came out but [as of yesterday](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWdxqUQjsbY&list=UU7-iNajG033J_66k16whthw&index=1&feature=plcp) we know that preview 7 is coming very soon and has some awesome features :)

- [fruux.com](https://fruux.com/) is a sync-service for everyone who won't rely on iCloud or has the trouble with iOS, Android or other devices. Sync calendars, contacts and other things between all your devices.

- Fantasai shares the story about ["The Evolution of CSS Layout: 1990s to the Future"](http://fantasai.inkedblade.net/weblog/2012/css-layout-evolution/). It tells the story how we built CSS layout until now, it tells about real CSS layout that is coming soon via W3C specification and it tells about print comparisons. Very interesting story!

- Adobe Shadow can be used in different ways. Use your own servers (using node.js + npm weinre), use [xip.io as proxy](http://blogs.adobe.com/shadow/2012/06/19/shadow-xip-io-virtual-hosts-workflow-simplified/), use it with [LiveReload and iOS](http://blogs.adobe.com/shadow/2012/04/24/shadow-livereload-workflow/) or [use typekit with localhost](http://blogs.adobe.com/shadow/2012/06/04/shadow-typekit-localhost-workflow/). _And, be sure to check the [labs site](http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/shadow/) the next hours and days. I expect something new to happen thereâ€¦_

- At least, if you're a German reader (sorry again for all my English people), check out my video of [Adobe's Creative Summer](http://www.adobe.com/de/event/creativesummer/web-mobile.html). I talked about Adobe Dreamweaver CS6, Responsive Webdesign, Responsive Images, Adobe Shadow, PhoneGap and PhoneGap Build and the Adobe WebPlatform:
