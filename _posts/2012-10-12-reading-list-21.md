title: "Reading List #21"
---

**This week was stuffed with great content on the web. I still have about 35 tabs opened in my browser to read on. So this reading list will be big. But as every week the web changes and evolves fast!**

First I want to promote an event here because it is in my personal interest to get as many interested people there as possibleâ€¦

[Hans wrote](http://drublic.de/blog/conference-test-the-web-forward/) about the last weeks stuffed with conferences and calls for participation on [TestTheWebForward in Paris](http://testthewebforward.org/paris-2012.html) later this month.

If you want to contribute to W3C or WHATWG or just want to help [MoveTheWebForward](http://movethewebforward.org/) you should attend to the hacker-session in Paris on October, 26th-27th. You will learn how to write tests for browsers and specs and how to report back to make the web a better place!

## Weekly Reading List

- Besides [SPIF](https://github.com/kig/multires/tree/master/spif) which is a problematic responsive file format due to HTTP-Request header changes are needed to get this working there now is **[MultiRes](http://fhtr.org/multires/)**. It is an image format which loads the specific needed image resolution depending on your device resolution responsively. Of course it is still very experimental but already working with JavaScript.

- Did you know it is **better to serve Retina images with super-low quality** (JPEG/WebP) instead of high quality standard images and you can still save filesize with this? [Daan Jobsis wrote about it](http://blog.netvlies.nl/design-interactie/retina-revolution/) with some examples

- The **[WebPlatform](http://www1.webplatform.org/)** is live. This huge project is supported by all major forces of the web: developers, UA-vendors, documenters, engineers. It is a platform where you should looking at when searching for some web-tech documentation. Don't use W3Schools (really, you never should have been using it)! Read the [article by PPK](http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2012/10/webplatformorg.html) for more information

- If you had the chance to attend to Fronteers12 Jam session and listened to Rodney Rehm you already heard of some basics how to design your API code. Now here is his [extended version on smashingmag.com](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2012/10/09/designing-javascript-apis-usability/). A long article telling interesting insights on best-practices for JavaScript code

- Don't initialize all the things in **jQuery.ready()**! Better use [just in time initialization](http://www.elijahmanor.com/2012/10/dont-initialize-all-things-in.html)

- Chris Heilmann [summed up the Fronteers 2012](http://christianheilmann.com/2012/10/08/fronteers12-qa-results-quick-reviews-and-impressions-from-the-stage/). If you missed the conference just check his post

- If you haven't already heard of **[Miso](http://misoproject.com/)** and have huge client projects with documentation you might want to check it out. It is a web tool for interactive storytelling and documentation.

- [Flexbox Creator](http://demo.agektmr.com/flexbox/)

## Apps

- **[Taskbox](http://taskbox.co/)** is a Kickstarter project I would love to back but as I currently am an Android user and support the open-platform and the open-web approach I won't. For now they only are building an iOS app which shall make work with email faster and much easier.
