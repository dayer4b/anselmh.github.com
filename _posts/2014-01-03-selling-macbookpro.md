title: "Selling: Apple MacBook Pro 15” Mid 2010"
---

I am selling one of my work machines as I never used it too much in favor of my MacBook Air 11”.
The powerful (still today!) MacBook Pro got an manual upgrade by me with an SSD (via [Hardwrk Kit](http://hardwrk.com/en/ssd-hdd-adapter-kit-for-macbook-pro.html)) and has been taken with care.
Most of the time it was on a Desktop stand, connected to an external Monitor.

## Facts / Tech Data:

- [Apple MacBook Pro Mid 2010](http://support.apple.com/kb/sp582) (6,2)
- Intel Core i5 2.4GHz
- 15.4 inch display with 1680 x 1050px
- 8 GB RAM
- NVIDIA GeForce GT 330M with 256MB GDDR3 & Intel HD Graphics with 256MB shared SDRAM
- Mini DisplayPort
- **NO CD/DVD SuperDrive**
- **120GB Kingston Hyper X SSD** (use this as OS X disc)
- **320GB HDD** (the default Apple one)
- only 51 Battery Cycles!
- Runs Mac OS X 10.9

## Price

As this thing is in a very good condition and I only sell it because I don’t need it,
I want to have **950 EUR** excl. VAT and shipping. This in my opinion is a very fair price
and is based on official calculations by several online sellers.
I will include a nice bag for it, too. Of course power adapter will also be included.
