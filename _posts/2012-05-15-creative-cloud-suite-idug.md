title: "Creative Cloud - Suite 6 IDUG DE-Tour 2012"
---

Right after the [DPK12](http://anselm-hannemann.com/blog/2012/05/) I had some days to organize my normal life. Only several days later, I travelled to Düsseldorf where the [IDUG Rhein/Ruhr](http://www.indesignusergroup.com/chapters/rhein-ruhr/) gave the kick-off to the [CS6 IDUG DE-Tour](http://indesignusergroup.de/).

I travelled to most of the German chapters of the InDesign User groups and supported them to present the brand new Creative Suite 6 and Creative Cloud. Along with Ingo Eichel and Markus Jasker from Adobe the chapter representatives and I presented the new features of the applications in CS6.

1. My first stop was at the FH Düsseldorf where over 90 people attended to the event and we had a great start with IDUG-RR. <img src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/410926_398737123500273_179343735439614_1221399_120775511_o.jpg" width="650">

2. In Cologne we had over 100 people listening to us in the Betahaus Cologne and the nice after-party for our chapter rep Tim Gouder who had his birthday the next day. <img src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/319847_10150721690987101_88302222100_9548531_544786294_n.jpg" width="650">

3. My third stop was in Berlin where we had two separate meetings: one in the afternoon and one in the evening. Counting them together we had more than 110 people attending and the feedback was great!
The days after, I stayed in Berlin and had some great days there, meeting some really cool people! <img src="http://www.idug-berlin.de/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0298.jpg" width="650">

4. The following Monday I arrived at Frankfurt/Offenbach where the next meeting was held. The IDUG Rhein/Main held the meeting at the "Weinstube" (wine-bar) with a great atmosphere. Also more than 60 people were sitting in the small rooms and listened carefully to the news of the Creative Suite 6.

5. Now I skipped the meeting in Stuttgart where Orhan Tançgil replaced my part and the meeting in Zurich/Bern (Switzerland) where Haeme Ulrich and Michel Mayerle showed the news.
Instead, I had two days spare before our meeting in Munich was held on thursday. Our special guest besides Ingo Eichel from Adobe was [Klaas Posselt](http://www.einmanncombo.de/) from the IDUG Berlin. We had over 110 people in our room at [tgm]() and got very positive feedback from the crowd! Also we had free beer after the show because we had something to party: IDUG Munich had its 4th birthday on this meeting! That means the IDUGM exists already for four exciting years!

6. Finally I arrived at Hamburg together with Klaas the next day and we had one of the worst hotel experience. 125€ per night (and person) for a chamber which had no wifi, no TV and very bad service. Nevertheless we had a wonderful IDUG meeting in Hamburg and showed some more news about Creative Cloud and CS6.
To finish the last wonderful weeks we had a great dinner and a great night!

For those who didn't attend to one of the meetings I will also say what I talked about at the meetings: I showed off the features of Adobe Photoshop CS6, Dreamweaver CS6, Adobe Edge and Adobe Digital Publishing Suite 2.0!

Now I will need some time to recover and doing the "normal" working stuff. Some nice projects are waiting for me and I am looking forward to the next weeks of summer! :)
