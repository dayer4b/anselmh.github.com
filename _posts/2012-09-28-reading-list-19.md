**After one week break from the weekly newslist here it is again. I was at FromTheFront last week which is a totally awesome italian frontend conference, so I couldn't manage to summarize the week last time. This time I have cool stuff for you:**

- [**Your CSS is a mess**](https://speakerdeck.com/u/snookca/p/your) tells us how to write CSS in a better way. Told by the master himself &ndash; Jonathan Snook

- [The Web Aesthetic](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/the-web-aesthetic/) by Paul Robert Lloyd is an article about you as creator, designer and decision-maker on the web. You decide wether the web looks good or not. It's definitely worth reading it.

- Adobe held the CreateTheWeb conference in S.F. this Monday and they presented the whole Adobe Edge Web suite which is very cool. But they also showed us really great stuff: The [CSS Filter Lab](http://html.adobe.com/webstandards/csscustomfilters/cssfilterlab/).

- If you are in web / mobile branch, **create an Open Device Lab**! See [on Smashing Mag how-to](http://mobile.smashingmagazine.com/2012/09/24/establishing-an-open-device-lab/).

- _"Application cache is a douchebag"_ says Jake Archibald (who is now joining Google Developer Relations). [This presentation](https://speakerdeck.com/u/jaffathecake/p/application-cache-douchebag) gives you a clue why AppCache is a douchebag.
