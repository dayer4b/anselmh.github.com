title: "#11 The crazy weekly"
---

**This week there is a very extraordinary ship in my link list. Why? Because it is so crazy you have to see it. But some webdev and DPS stuff is also attached :)**

- This is Wally, the mega yacht. Check out their website to see more awesome boats: <a href="http://www.wally.com/why/">![mega-yacht on sea](/assets/images/blog/2012-07-06/wy.jpg)</a>

- Now [this presentation](https://speakerdeck.com/u/matthewreidsma/p/responsive-web-design-for-libraries-get-beyond-the-myth-of-the-mobile-web-1) shows you a summary on what is responsive webdesign. It really is worth it!

- Improved developer tooling, [read](http://addyosmani.com/blog/improved-developer-tooling-and-yeoman/) an see the video.

- [How to build](http://thephuse.com/development/build-responsive-websites-faster-with-sass/) responsive webdesigns faster with SASS.

- Now let's face it: Finally there seems to be a way to [link between DPS publications](http://digitalpublishing.tumblr.com/post/26564811021/cross-publication-linking-bonus-qr-codes) and it is not that hacky as the last try by Johannes was. As a bonus learn how to create QR codes for a DPS-publication link.

### UPDATE:

I just forgot one good link:

- This is about a student who [rebranded Microsoft to a better brand](http://www.minimallyminimal.com/journal/2012/7/3/the-next-microsoft.html).
