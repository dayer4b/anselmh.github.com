title: "You wonder why 'The Daily' failed?"
---

**Yesterday Rupert Murdoch announced the end of 'The Daily' for the iPad. Media gone wild but actually the failure is no surprise.**

Rupert Murdoch is a clever man who invested a lot of money in his tablet product very early. He was one of the men who did understand that a tablet magazine cannot be a print-derivate and also costs money you won't get back after just a few months.

Nevertheless he now realized that it is too expensive to keep the production of 'The Daily' for iPad. Here are some reasons why the magazine has failed:

1. **Costs:** Back in July up to 170 employees [worked](http://allthingsd.com/20120731/the-daily-lays-off-a-third-of-its-staff/) on 'The Daily'. This is a huge amount of people and even after a lay off round in August cutting 50 people off this means the production costs are very high. The initial costs for the publication are estimated at $30million! If you want to read more about the costs, [Daring Fireball nailed it](http://daringfireball.net/2012/12/why_the_daily_failed).  
_Are you really wondering why this concept wouldn't work out finally?_

2. **iPad-only**: The publication is an iPad only application with no way to read the newspaper on a Android device or as web-magazine.

3. **Fixed layouts**: The publication is a fixed layout. This is the same problem most common digital publishing solutions have for now. Instead of making a responsive and adaptive layout that automatically adapts to the different screen-sizes you have to publish a version for each single screen-size.  
It is easy to say that this is much more effort each day than not caring about single sizes.

**Long story, short conclusion: Start smart (small team), serve everywhere, be responsive!**
