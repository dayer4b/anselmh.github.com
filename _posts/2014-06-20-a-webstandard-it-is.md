Nearly three years [after the initial request](http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2011-August/032977.html) for a native responsive images solution in HTML, `<picture>`, `srcset` and `sizes` finally are officially a web standard.

Both, WHATWG and W3C landed patches in the past week including the `<picture>` element and its attributes to the HTML5 specification.

And here are the specifications for each on WHATWG and W3C sites:

- [WHATWG `<picture>`](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/edits.html#the-picture-element)
- [WHATWG `srcset`](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/edits.html#attr-img-srcset)
- [WHATWG `sizes`](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/edits.html#attr-img-sizes)
- [W3C `<picture>`](http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/embedded-content.html#the-picture-element)
- [W3C `srcset`](http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/embedded-content.html#attr-picture-source-srcset)
- [W3C `sizes`](http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/embedded-content.html#attr-picture-source-sizes)

This is the official part, the living standard is always to be found at [picture.responsiveimages.org](http://picture.responsiveimages.org/) to which you can submit bugs and issues on GitHub via [RICG](http://responsiveimages.org/).

This is a good point to say thank you to all who are involved into Responsive Images work. Special thanks goes to:

- Mathew Marquis, the chairman
- Marcos Cacares, the one who fought for it in the webstandard consortiums
- Yoav Weiss, the one who made all possible (technically, implementation-wise)
- Geri Coady, who did the design work
- Simon Pieters, Tab Atkins, Matthew Wilcox, Bruce Lawson, Eric Portis, John Schoenick, Robin Berjon, Adam Bradley, Jason Grigsby, Scott Jehl, Kornel Lesinski, David Newton, and a whole lot more people who are all awesome!
