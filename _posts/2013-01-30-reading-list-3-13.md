- **Today The Nitty Gritty published a huge article by [Bastian Allgeier](https://twitter.com/bastianallgeier): A draft for the [future of the web](http://thenittygritty.co/the-future-of-the-web-a-draft).** This is an excellent read going through the problems of our nowadays social media life and centralized personal data. I can only recommend but you damn should read that piece of text!

- Often it turns out people reading articles written on a high-level do not think about how to deal with the content in their actual work. This lead Harry Roberts write this excellent summary about **[Know your context and think for yourself](http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/you-know-your-context-on-critical-thinking-and-thinking-for-yourself/)**

- Another excellent blog post about how our industry works when you are hired can be found here: Kyle Neath writes about his story to get work **[and tells how hard it can be](http://warpspire.com/posts/pixels-dont-care/)**. He states it gets better today and this is totally right but still it is very hard to get a job in a company like Google if you don't have studied. Companies, give up your prejudices and be brave!

- **[Write efficient JavaScript](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2012/11/05/writing-fast-memory-efficient-javascript/)** by Addy Osmani is great to learn what to avoid when you write JavaScript.

- Free online course **[Faster Websites: Crash Course on Web Performance](http://www.igvita.com/2013/01/15/faster-websites-crash-course-on-web-performance/)** by Ilya Grigorik

- Mr. Hans-Christian Reinl has some really good **[SASS-Mixins](https://github.com/drublic/SASS-Mixins)** in his github account. They include some cool stuff that makes your CSS life easier. Recently shorthand syntax for some were added.

- The **a11y** project published an **[accessibility checklist for web developers](http://a11yproject.com/checklist.html)**. I think that is a good way to improve accessibility on your site. Check it!

- Jay published a [blogpost about opendevicelab.com](http://klick-ass.com/awesomeness/opendevicelab-com-a-directory-to-a-global-movement/) :)
