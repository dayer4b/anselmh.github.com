**After one week of pause I'm quickly pushing another edition of my weekly link tipps before my birthday tomorrow.**

Here we go:

## Testing tools and suites

- [Modernizr 2.6.2 is out](http://modernizr.com/news/modernizr-262/) and has some new things: position sticky, CSS's @supports, input[form], bugfixes and improvements

- Firefox 15 developer tools update [with amazing new features](http://anselm-hannemann.com/blog/2012/09/01/firefox-16-developer-tools-update/): make screenshots of selected elements, view media queries inside the not-resized browser window!

## New things

- We now have a [position: sticky; option in CSS](http://updates.html5rocks.com/2012/08/Stick-your-landings-position-sticky-lands-in-WebKit)

## W3C news

- The W3C moved a step forward and its specification of HTML [is now on github](https://github.com/w3c/html)!

- There is a big discussion going on about our [responsive images thing](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2012Aug/0427.html) at W3C mailing list. If you want to discuss, just be part of it and sign the agreement to discuss with us!
