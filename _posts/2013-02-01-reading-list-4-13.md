---

**Catch up! Second reading list for this week. Again wonderful content came up so I decided to show them to you as usual on Friday even the last list was published only two days ago.**


- **A draft [how to order your CSS selectors](http://meiert.com/en/blog/20130130/how-to-order-css-selectors/)**. Many good thoughts in it, so if you care about your CSS read it!

- Mariana Mota wrote a lovely blog post for **[Designers, have you ever attended a hackday? Do it.](http://www.marianamota.com/portfolio/designers-have-you-ever-attended-a-hackday-do-it/)** and mentions good points why everyone should do that!

- **Improving Readability** can sometimes be tricky. [Adobe Webplatform team found a solution](http://blogs.adobe.com/webplatform/2013/01/30/balancing-text-for-better-readability/).

- A List Apart writer Jeffrey Zeldman wrote **[on alt-text](http://alistapart.com/blog/post/on-alt-text)** and its usage by web developers

- **How do you test CSS?** Of course, write, save, upload, reload, view, debug. No! **[Here's how](http://csste.st/slides/)**

- Did you know you can **[turn GitHub issues into pull-requests](http://germanforblack.com/post/41822392266/github-workflow)** with hub?

- Audio recording of **[Aral Balkan's The high cost of free](https://soundcloud.com/mkgn/mkgn03-aral-balkan)** talk. I listened easily to the 44mins because it's easy to follow and all makes sense. Kindly [Aral](http://twitter.com/aral) offered me to upload his slides so here you go: [watch his slides to the audio recording](https://speakerdeck.com/aral/the-high-cost-of-free).
