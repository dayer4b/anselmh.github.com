title: "Deutsche Publishing-Konferenz 2012"
---

My last blog post has been published several weeks ago. I apologize the delay and want to report what happened. But first I want to say thank you to all my supporters and people helped me making all the great things recently!

Most of you may have already heard that I have been co-organizing a big conference in Germany: The ["Deutsche Publishing-Konferenz 2012"](http://publishing-konferenz.de/).
Last year I started to think about doing a conference for publishing in Germany. I also met with [Hans Neumair](http://pub-com.de/) and [Wolf Eigner](http://complizenwerk.de/eigner), my [IDUG Munich](http://www.indesignusergroup.com/chapters/munich/) colleagues who had the same idea. Back then there were no such events here but the demand by people was high. With [Klaas Posselt](http://einmanncombo.de/), [Stephan Mitteldorf](http://51nullacht.de/), [Tim Gouder](http://indesign-blog.de/) and Hans Neumair I started to organize this event in Munich. Our host [c//m//t GmbH](http://www.cmt.de/) supported us in the background, thanks for that! We worked very hard for the last 13 months to let this be an awesome event. And that it was! This is me presenting some cool DPS stuff on the main stage…

On April, 27th, when all things finally had been prepared and all speakers had arrived at the Hotel Vitalis in Munich the DPK12 opened its doors for over 200 attendees.
After the keynote we had the chance to present a very unique and special thing to our attendees – the Adobe Creative Suite 6 was showed live the first time in Europe (I really don't know if worldwide but chance is very good!) only 3 days after Adobe announced it online!

[Rufus Deuchler](http://rufus.deuchler.net/) showed the most awesome features of Photoshop CS6, Illustrator CS6 and InDesign CS6 as well as other cool stuff. Also the Creative Cloud has been presented live (which is also pretty awesome because it has never been shown live before!) with Touch Apps and Cloud sync. People were pretty impressed by this new stuff and the public response was great!

Friday evening the conference party took place with a show-programm and the after-party with some speakers and the internal-staff (us) ended late.
Luckily the weather was very nice and we had sunny days without any clouds at 27-32°C!! What a nice play together… ;)

The next day started with a relaxed kick-off at 10a.m. but when Tim Gouder presented InDesign tips and tricks the room was full while Markus Jasker and Ingo Eichel presented the Creative Cloud live to the crowd next door!
Some other great talks followed and finally we reached the end of the event at 5p.m.. The feedback for DPK12 was so amazing that we were totally blown away by the positiveness and great response!
Thanks to all who attended the event and liked, supported or somehow said something about it!

As a side note I have to give the link to my presentation I held at DPK12 about **"Adobe Digital Publishing Suite for Pro's"** here.
