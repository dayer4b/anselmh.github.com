title: "13th roundup of the week"
---

**Now this week was full of work, full of news and awesome things. Let's round-up.**

1. **Reflection 1.4 beta2** is [ready to download](http://www.reflectionapp.com/download/Mac/Reflection_1.4b2.dmg). The version features iOS6 and Mountain Lion support, and will feature [some more features later on](http://reflectionapp.com/updates/notes/1.4.html) in upcoming betas.

2. Want to **load TypeKit async** and non-blocking? Then [here is a github repo](https://github.com/typekit/typekit-async-patterns) how to solve these problems and enhance the webfont experience on your website.

3. **[Get resolution independent on font-sizes](https://github.com/kickingvegas/12pt-should-be-the-same-everywhere/blob/master/absoluteMeasurementDPI.md)**. This small repo shows why you should offer resolution independent font-sizes on your website or application.

4. Adobe WebPlatform Team published an **[article about image progress events](http://blogs.adobe.com/webplatform/2012/07/10/image-progress-event-progress/)**. This is about the loading progress of images on a website and how to control and target it. This will be very helpful to control the image loading on websites and it is helpful for responsive images as well as you can control which image to load on which device/resolution/UA.

5. With the problem of responsive images, Matt Wilcox brought up another problem and a solution for it: **HTML variables**. This would have been super useful for responsive images media-queries, anchors and URLs as well as other markup patterns. We left that out for the responsive images solution but now Ville V. Vanninen (AKA sakamies) [published a javascript](https://github.com/sakamies/headcase.js) that allows to use these variables on your HTML.  
_Just be aware that this can completely break your markup and website if JS is disabled and that the script increases your initial load time._

6. Christian Heilmann [asks for your help](https://plus.google.com/111552931212713155841/posts/RkpYBcJQf5S). He wants to know what **Javascript frameworks you're using** when developing a mobile (web-)App. Just [fill out his quick survey](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGZ3b2l0WTI5YkVUZjZhLWZZWnhsc1E6MQ) to move the web forward.

7. The popular **caniuse.com** website for browser support of HTML5 and CSS support now includes mobile Firefox and mobile Chrome. See how to [display these edge-browsers here](http://caniuse.com/feed/132).

8. **"Deploy via FTP is so 90`s"** – yes, that is what [Kerrick](http://coderwall.com/kerrick) Long [shared on his coderwall](http://coderwall.com/p/xczkaq). And he's right – just use git instead.

And that's it for the week.
