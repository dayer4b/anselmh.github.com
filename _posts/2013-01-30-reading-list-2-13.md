**Boom! New link list this week has some very cool stuff for you! Read:**

- After several months of work my project with Andre Jay Meissner and Christian Schäfer called **[opendevicelab.com](http://opendevicelab.com/)** just launched! This project helps you to find places where you can test websites, web-apps on many mobile devices.

- **[Problematic of the HTML5 semantic elements](http://www.netmagazine.com/features/truth-about-structuring-html5-page)** describes why several HTML5 elements do not work. Everyone is confused if to use section or article element but how to solve that? Read the article to get more information about this topic.

- **[Girl, develop it!](http://girldevelopit.com/)** is a site that encourages girls to develop more things. I like the idea and support it because there are too less women in our industry IMO.

- What we have now, what is coming and how the future of webstandards could be… This is what the following article is telling you: **[2013: web standards in perspective](http://www.netmagazine.com/features/2012-2013-web-standards-perspective)**

- Mozilla landed **[scoped styles and @supports in Firefox](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/01/firefox-development-highlights-h-264-mp3-support-on-windows-scoped-stylesheets-more/)** – yay!

- **[Conferences burned by PayPal](http://conferencesburnedbypaypal.tumblr.com/)** is a site that tells you about how PayPal is dealing with conference organizers and why you really should be aware of these problems and consider twice if you want to offer PayPal payment.

- **[About source maps and where we are](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/tools-and-tips/source-maps-101/)** – by the way: Google's CDNed jQuery has it enabled since 1.9.0

- Last night **[GitHub announced Zen mode](https://github.com/blog/1379-zen-writing-mode)**. That mode allows you to go fullscreen when editing, writing files, wiki or issues. Cool thing I will use regularly.

- My dear friend Mathew Marquis has build a cool tool that helps you writing documentation pages for HTML files **[X-rayHTML](https://github.com/filamentgroup/X-rayHTML)**
