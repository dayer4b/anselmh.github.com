2014 is over now and as in the past year I want to recap the past year and reflect what happened.

_Note: This is a personal article and there’s at least no technical take away in here._

2014 started with a big change. In December 2013 I said ‘yes’ to my biggest project
yet in my career and I started January, 6th, in my new team. This included moving
from Munich to Cologne for what I thought would last six month and took out 9.5 months.
For me this was a tough decision as my girlfriend, my friends and my beloved mountains stayed in Munich. Nevertheless as it’s only planned for half a year and the opportunity was great, I decided to do this step and it was absolutely right. I had the chance to work with my friend [Hans](https://drublic.de/) to build a super large-scale front end infrastructure at [Vaillant](http://vaillant-group.com/) and met a lot of amazing developers, managers, other people and with a lot of them, I became friends. I learned a lot about scalability, maintainability and working together as people in larger teams.

In fact, I really enjoyed the new city. Cologne is a beautiful, nice city with a lot of small coffee roasters, and other independent shops. It also has a lot of nice bars and people to meet. When I went to the park once to enjoy the sun, I stumbled over some slackliners and I became friends with them immediately. From that sunny and warm day in March I went slacklining every possible weekend, improving my personal skills a lot (previously I could walk around 25m, now I’m walking 50m and tried to walk even longer lines around 100 meters).

Work-wise I learned how to scale a front-end architecture to drive dozens of websites later on, build a toolchain around it and how to build it rock-solid with more than ten people working on the code-base. Together with Hans we built our own tools, scripts, decoupled tools from each other and came up with a very stable architecture that works for everyone in the team. I met a lot of great friends in this project and hope we’ll stay in contact in the future.

Over easter, I decided to make a short four day trip to Italy for some mountainbiking with one of my best friends. We took his car, put our bikes in and went to the Lake of Garda. The first two days were amazing and we had a lot of fun although the 2nd was very rainy and we went to the sunny Venice for an afternoon. Pssst... biking in the city is strongly forbidden (if you wonder).

The third day, it was Sunday, I saw that my mother had called me. Somehow I felt it
was important and usually she tries not to call me during vacation. I called her back
and she told me that my grandfather had died last night. He had been in hospital for some days before but initially all said it wasn’t something serious. Finally, on friday they re-checked him and found out that he’d urgently need stents and other stuff.

We all knew that he wouldn’t live forever but no one had expected it so quickly as he
was all well, had no serious illness and most of the time was happy. But he always said
“I don’t want to be in need of another person to live”. And as he heard that this wouldn’t be possible anymore (you will need assistance if you get stents at this age),
I think he decided to not live anymore.

The following days were very tough and while I stayed the same day and went biking to
think about it and get a clearer mind, we went back to Munich the next morning and I stayed the whole week with my family. It wasn’t tragic and we knew it’s the best for him and probably his own decision but still it’s very sad and forces you to think about family, life and all these things. He’ll always be remembered, I learned a lot from him.

In early May, me and Christian Schäfer (also known as “Schepp”) went to London to attend the netawards ceremony. I had been nominated as [Young Developer of the Year 2014](https://thenetawards.com/) and also opendevicelab.com was nominated as Game Changer of the year. And while I did not win, I enjoyed being there meeting lots of people and having a very fine dinner.

The obligatory visit to the btconf in Düsseldorf followed and was as always a great experience. Especially because we were able to see the impressive fireworks of the Japan festival and we had an amazing Web Platform Doc Sprint the day before the conference.

On a weekend I travelled to Rüsselsheim (near Frankfurt) to visit a large slackline festival. That was the chance to walk new lines I’ve never been able to do before. I finally were able to try out my first highline (about 15m high, 15 long), failed miserably (could walk like 3-4 steps) but it was a great (though painful) experience.

In June, my own conference [PUBKON](http://2014.pubkon.eu/), took place for the third time. It was a lot of effort and a great success regarding what people left us as feedback, even though we struggled a lot in advance as tickets didn’t sell too well and break-even was reached only two weeks prior to the event.

Late June, I also met with [Sebastian](https://twitter.com/asciidisco), [Hans](https://twitter.com/drublic), [Simon](https://twitter.com/agorilla) and David to speak about making an event in Cologne. Turned out we all want to do such a thing and the result was our own front-end conference which took place in September.

In July I decided to keep on working for my biggest ever project for three more months.
The only change was that I was going to work from my homeoffice most of the time and
only I only was in the office for the sprint plannings and reviews. This meant I had two residences to manage and travel between each during the week which is quite exhausting if you do it regularly. But to be honest, being able to work remotely worked very fine. I could start working earlier (not the usual 9 to 5 schedule as in the office) and were more flexible. I could also focus more on my work as no one could distract me, except in HipChat (which you can easily set to N/A state). And communication with my team worked very good as well, we constantly chatted, WebRTC’ed and had a lot of fun. To summarise: Working remote in a 99% on-site team worked very fine for me, even better than I would have expected.

I started August taking two weeks off and go on vacation. Initially I planned
to go to Switzerland’s Berner Alps with some friends and my mountainbike but the weather was very bad and made our plans impossible (it had snow over there). So we changed plans and went climbing in the Frankenjura in Germany, a great place with many many spots and interesting routes. I climbed my first 8- at the end of the week (okay, scale is not the same as in the Alps, but still…).

September started with [Reasons To Be Creative](http://reasons.to/) where I met great friends again and made some new and also finally went to Brighton and Camebridge. It was very nice and I can only recommend the conference, if you’re up for creative inspiration.

Only two days later I attended the [Red Bull District Ride](http://www.redbull.com/de/de/bike/events/1331636353775/red-bull-district-ride) in Nuremberg which was awesome. Mountainbikers rode directly though the masses of people in the city and did amazing tricks in the air.

Then, on September 26th, another side project I had been involved in for four months took place. Together with Hans Christian Reinl, Sebastian Golasch, Simon Koch, and David Yasli I organized my first web related conference. The so called [NightlyBuild conference](http://www.nightlybuild.io/) was thought as after-work conference was a lot of effort and we managed to invite speakers such as Aral Balkan, Alice Bartlett, Ian Feather, Nico Hagenburger, Jasmin Boje and Steffen Süpple to make the evening a great experience for every attendee. In summary it was a great success and we sold out only a couple of weeks after we launched tickets. We’re currently thinking about how we proceed with this project and if we want to make it happen again.

October was the last month for my main client this year and it turned out well. The
project made great progress and as of now, most things I’ve helped building launched
successfully.

I then attended the second [border:none](https://border-none.net/2014) conference which was made in a completely new format as a creator-conference and it did make much sense to attend it. I learned a lot of new stuff about security, privacy and the indie web.

Then I travelled to Cardiff with Hans to attend TheWeb.is, a web conference by Craig Lockford, and flew back to Berlin where the first [beyond tellerrand](http://beyondtellerrand.com/berlin-2014/) by my friend Marc Thiele in Berlin took place. It’s always a great place to meet a mass of nice people and friends.

The last conference of the year was on the list in November: [dotCSS and dotJS](http://www.dotcss.io/) in Paris, France. For that, I decided to make it a short-trip with my girl-friend and while I met nice people at the conferences and learned new interesting stuff we also had the chance to visit the city and enjoyed a few days of vacation together.

In December, I got an inquiry if I could help a Munich start-up cleaning up and refactoring their historically grown codebase. Unfortunately they had already started doing it and needed me as soon as possible which meant I only could work eight days for them. But in this short timeframe I still managed to re-build the principles of their infrastructure on a new toolchain, set up stricter coding conventions and decreased their output CSS code by nearly 80% on their production site. It was also a great team with a vision of their product and I’m eager to know when their re-factoring will be finished and go live.

Also in December I took some days to work on my own projects, like WDRL to refactor the code, improve the design and readability and to figure out how to make the project at least not a loss (money wise). I’m still not finished and have big plans with it but I think I at least gave it some love it really deserves. With over 4.5k subscribers receiving a fron-end article summary each week WDRL is my biggest side-project today and I am truly humbled by all the great feedback I get for it.

For Christmas I took some days off again and enjoyed it with my family and friends. I have made a couple of new year resolutions already; I hope you’ve made some, too, and together we can start improving the world, our livings and lifes a bit more. Happy new Year! :)
