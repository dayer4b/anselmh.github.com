Wow. **I am nominated for the netawards 2014 as Young Developer of the Year**. This is huge and when I read this first I couldn’t believe it. I’m still totally stoked about the support and only can say **“Thank you for your support!”**.

Of course I’d be happy if you give me your vote:

Thanks again to anyone who nominated me and to everyone who will vote for me. You’re all awesome. &hearts;
