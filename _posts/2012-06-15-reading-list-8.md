title: "[Weekly Roundup #8] Links of the week"
---

**After some weeks of silence for the links of the week here is the new issue.**

- [Blossom.io](https://www.blossom.io/) &ndash; a project management tool for $9/month which looks promising and as easy as the new Basecamp is (by the way: the new Basecamp is awesome except it has no mobile website view).

- Here is a nice article about the [new CSS3 OpenType features](http://www.typotheque.com/articles/opentype_features_in_web_browsers) and how you can use it. Also a comparison chart is there to display which browsers support the specific styles.

- Finally this silly scaling bug is resolved in iOS6:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="de"><p>I have seen it with my own eyes: as of iOS 6.0, the orientationchange/scale bug is dead.<a href="http://t.co/kfeBye74" title="http://filamentgroup.com/examples/iosScaleBug/">filamentgroup.com/examples/iosSc…</a></p>&mdash; Mat “Wilto” Marquis (@wilto) <a href="https://twitter.com/wilto/status/212636063762628608" data-datetime="2012-06-12T20:02:42+00:00">Juni 12, 2012</a></blockquote>

- I am talking about responsive images in German podcast ["Working Draft"](http://workingdraft.de/73/) and  about CSS compositing, CSS blending, Quota Management API and CORS.
As of this, Matthew Wilcox [wrote for the Opera Dev Channel](http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/responsive-images-problem/) a big summary of the topic, too.

- If you thought SPDY is this brilliant performant and superfast new "HTTP" you might be wrong. Guy Podjarny [shows the results](http://www.guypo.com/technical/not-as-spdy-as-you-thought/).

- iOS6 will have increased AppCache and now is up to 25MB:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="de"><p>Hey, <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%2523iOS6">#iOS6</a> will have increased HTML5 <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%2523AppCache">#AppCache</a> up to 25MB (5MB currently)!</p>&mdash; Anselm Hannemann (@anselmhannemann) <a href="https://twitter.com/anselmhannemann/status/212435080516349952" data-datetime="2012-06-12T06:44:04+00:00">Juni 12, 2012</a></blockquote>

- The [new tools for developers in iOS6](http://taitems.tumblr.com/post/24936855546/what-ios-6-mobile-safari-offers-front-end-devs).

- Apple presented its own maps tool for iOS6 so they don't have to rely on Google's Maps. Here is a comparison what the tools look like each other: ["Your own maps, eh?"](http://ganzfrische.frischmil.ch/post/24944710178)

- I wrote an [article about MODX Revolution](http://screengui.de/magazin/magazin-archiv/detail/e-payment-css4-boilerplates.html) in the German magazine "Screenguide". If you haven't tried MODX yet and you're from Germany get this issue. It also contains several very interesing articles in the same issue of the magazine about web development, HTML5 and CSS4.
