title: "[Weekly] How to do better"

**This friday we're talking about how to become a better web-person and some technical stuff!**

## Being a better web citizen

[Chris Heilmann](http://christianheilmann.com/) posted a blog entry this week because he is annoyed by the going on rant on social media platforms about products, events and persons. He writes why ranting hurts people and doesn't do anything good to anyone. Finally after reading this blog hopefully some more people understand how to really help the web and other people in it.

- [BEING A BETTER WEB CITIZEN: COMPLAIN WHERE THINGS GET FIXED](http://christianheilmann.com/2012/08/20/being-a-better-web-citizen-complain-where-things-get-fixed/)

- Now there is a list by [Paul Irish](http://paulirish.com/) that includes various genius developers that are not well known yet. He tries to recommend them to the masses and it's just lovely that he does that. Kinda cool move to promote other unknown good people!

## Responsive

- [Ian Devlin](http://iandevlin.com/) wrote about [Responsive HTML5 video](http://www.iandevlin.com/blog/2012/08/html5/responsive-html5-video). He shows what the problems are and concludes in the need of a responsive html-element which can handle multiple sources respecting media-queries… like the picture-element proposed by W3C now.

- [HIGH DPI IMAGES FOR VARIABLE PIXEL DENSITIES](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/mobile/high-dpi/) is an article published on html5rocks.com which describes the problem of variable density-displays and data-handling. Interesting in-depth read.

# CSS / WHATWG / W3C News

- [Cascading Attribute Sheet](http://www.xanthir.com/blog/b4K_0) by Tab Atkins Jr. is a proposed solution to have as easy syntax as CSS in HTML.

- Fantasai explains the history of web layout [Evolution of CSS Layout: 1990s to the Future](http://fantasai.inkedblade.net/weblog/2012/css-layout-evolution/). Well written story that explains much about the process…
