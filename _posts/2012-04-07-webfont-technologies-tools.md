title: "[Special Roundup #1] New webfont technologies and tools"
---

**This is a special roundup of links and facts about webfonts.  And happy easter by the way!**

## Icon-fonts!

- The last months you probably have seen many of those **"icon-fonts"**. They're just great and a huge improvement for icon usage on websites. But how in world should we know which one to use and where to get them from? Chris Coyer (CSS-Tricks) has summed up:
[Flat Icons and Icon fonts](http://css-tricks.com/flat-icons-icon-fonts/)

- Here's **Fontomas, a webfont / iconfont creator and subsetter**. You can make a limited symbols subset, with reduced font size, merge symbols from several fonts to single file, access large collections of professional-grade open source icons. Customize your fonts now!

- Then we have **Entypo, a great icon-font** you can use in your projects. It's under Creative Commons CC-BY-SA license and free to use with attribution. The good part is it's nice, it's free, it's SVG and OpenType and will have a webfont-service soon:

## Subsetting and webfont-generators!

- Now back to technology: FontFont released a handful tool called **"FF Subsetter" which let's you optimize your webfonts in just three steps**. You upload your webfont, reduce (by removing letters etc) or customize the font to your own settings, and download your custom webfont. Use this if you use local webfonts!

- I often had the problem to only have one font-file (even when it was explicitly a webfont, licensed) e.g. OpenType. But you all know we need to have at least 3-5 different formats of the font to get it working in all major browsers. This is where the **Fontsquirrel @font-face generator** jumps in: You upload your webfont and it will be processed by fontsquirrel to other formats. Then you can download your complete @font-face kit including all the different font-types (TrueType, EOT, SVG, SVGZ, WOFF), the bullet-proof html/css implementation. And you also can have an 'expert mode' where you can set many options about rendering, x-height-matching, subsetting, etc.

## Typography details!

- Google WebFonts with its API is one of the most known and important webfont resource we currently have. This combined with TypeKit and FontDeck is a powerful alliance and they now created a **Open Source project called "OpenTypography"**. This project has the goal to bring better typography to every device with a digital screen. It has very good but rather short explanations to typographic basics (or problems as they're known in the web today) such as Kerning, ligatures etc.

## Webfont licensing improved?

- But what about the future? We need lots of more options on typography for the web / screen. And one of the bad sides of the whole font-thing is licensing. **FontSlice is a new service trying to reduce font-costs** for digital fonts by only let users pay for letters / characters they are actually using. It is an interesting concept and I am curious about this.
