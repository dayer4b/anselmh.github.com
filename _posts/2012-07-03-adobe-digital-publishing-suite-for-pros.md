title: "Adobe Digital Publishing Suite for Pro's"
---

**I recently held a talk at Deutsche Publishing-Konferenz 2012 in Munich about Adobe's Digital Publishing Suite. Now the conference organizers (you might know I am part of it) published the video of the session. The presentation slides are build in, so just enjoy it. Only requirement is you understand German as it was a German conference.**
