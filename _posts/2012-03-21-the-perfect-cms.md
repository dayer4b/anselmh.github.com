title: "The perfect CMS?"
---

**Yesterday I shouted about extJS and you might have seen me shouting about my loved MODX CMS recently. I was asked by several people what I use as CMS instead of MODX. Answer is: none. I am searching for the perfect. Let me explainâ€¦**

My first choice is MODX as a CMS. It is so easy to develop a website with it and I only get the output I want. But there are some severe problems I have with it: Some user-experience issues and some bugs which made developing a site a pain recently.

But what to do now? I don't like TYPO3, Drupal, Wordpress and these systems at all. What I want is a CMS which provides me a basic interface (layout like MODX), no fancy js-framework behind it but functional. Better let me make a list:

- simple but functional manager
- no JS-driven manager (extJS, JQM), only jQuery or similar extensions for some fancy stuff
- responsive by default, so it's usable on every device
- easy customizable and extendable with HTML5, CSS and jQuery
- easy rights management (ACL)
- nested / multi Template Variables (like MIGX offers to MODX or Processwire has)
- easy blog system
- easy templating system (like MODX has)
- Markdown editor (I don't need TinyMCE, no one does), Markdown WYSIWYG for clients
- super-fast performance in frontend and backend, this is most important
- writing articles though Dropbox (send via e-mail or import frmo Dropbox maybe? API itself seems to slow)
- super easy way to handle forms (also multi-site forms) and store values

So I hope someone jumps in and please let me know why there's no such system on the market or if there is one! Write comments, share it. I just want the CMS-world to be a better place.
