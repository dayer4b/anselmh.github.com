title: "My Year 2013 in Review"
---


With 2013 the past year already, I write this recap to remember what I did in that year. 2013 was amazing for me and 2014 will begin with some changes like me moving to Cologne for the next six months.

----

In **January 2013** I had the opportunity to speak at the newcomer conference [TakeOff in Lille](http://takeoffconf.com/2013). It was a super-cold but an amazing time there: The hosts, all the other people and the beer were just lovely!

----

Next up we all met in Berlin to document the Web at the **Web Platform Doc Sprint**:

----

A few weeks later during deepest winter I travelled to Vienna where **[jQuery Conf Europe](http://events.jquery.org/2013/eu/)** took place at the impressive location Palais Liechtenstein.

----

Just two weeks later the first **[UX Munich Conference](http://uxmunich.com/)** opened its doors where I had the pleasure to listen to some great talks. I also did some conference notes:

----

In March I decided to get a new digital camera. I wanted to take more photos than before again and therefore wanted to have a digital cam (previously I only had several great old analog cameras). So [I bought a Fujifilm X-E1](http://helloanselm.com/2013/fuji-x-e1/).

----

Now followed two weeks **Bouldering in Fontainebleau**, a camping vacation with my friends that simply was so enjoyable that it's hard to describe. After an exhausting 2012 these 10 days off were solid gold for my work motivation (and for my bouldering skills).

----

Right back from vacation the final preparations for my own conference—**[the PUBKON](http://pubkon.eu/)**—went on. The conference itself, done the second time in 2013, gladfully was a huge success and we had an amazing time with all the attendees and speakers in Berlin.

Because I’m a bit silly, I spontaneously said ‘Yes’ when I was asked by the usual German conference crew if I wanna join on **FrontTrends** just two days later. Directly from Berlin I took the train to Warsaw which is a super lovely city I definitely want to visit again. The food, beer, and weather was great as was the time I've spend there…

Back at home I finished to build my DIY shelf made out of wine-boxes. Easy, but damn cool!

----

Summer came to Germany and I started to improve my Slackline skills and had very much fun with the guys from Munich who are much better than I.

----

In May I went to Düsseldorf to attend to the beyondtellerand conference which is always one of the best events I’ve ever been to.

----

When we (Jay, Christian, I) got nominated for the **netawards** at the end of 2012 with our non-profit platform [OpenDeviceLab.com](http://opendevicelab.com/) we never thought we’ll be part of the ceremony. In fact, we got invited, and took it as a chance to visit London again—a great city by itself.

By luck I met Alex Duloz there, who sports [The Pastry Box Project](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/) and we had a nice talk during breakfast. He’s a great guy I definitely want to see again soon. I also wrote a piece for TPB later on which is to be found [here](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/anselm-hannemann/2013-october-3).

---

Most weekends I’ve spent at home, I forced myself to go outside. I went hiking, climbing, Mountainbiking or Slacklining in the Mountains to re-fuel my power:

![](http://distilleryimage4.ak.instagram.com/e4411b4cd69911e2a72522000a1fb586_7.jpg)

During the week just in the evening I sometimes tried to walk on a Waterline (that is a Slickline rigged over a river or lake) but I wasn’t too successful except that it cooled me down often ;)

----

In June finally I got **my first printed book** which I wrote with two other authors.
![](http://distilleryimage7.ak.instagram.com/1e0b5f56d9cc11e2ada322000a1fbcdb_7.jpg)

Back then I decided to move the Reading Lists from my blog to a separate project, now called **[WDRL](http://wdrl.info/)**. I started the project with just a few readers, but the last months it grew massively and I’m stoked about the [success of this project](http://helloanselm.com/2013/the-wdrl-project-evolves/).

----

When the X-Games came to Munich I had to watch the Mountainbike Slopstyle event and [took some photos](http://helloanselm.com/2013/x-games-munich/).

August brought me a new Mountainbike which I completely built up manually from scratch with custom parts and all that cool stuff:
![](http://distilleryimage6.ak.instagram.com/8a408b8c01cd11e3b79722000aeb11d7_7.jpg)
With the new bike, a few tours had to be made:

The last week in August and the first week of September I spent in the Provence, France for vacation. It was a really relaxing time enjoying the beauty of the nature.

The last day of the trip was my birthday and so we went home driving through the Alps enjoying the beauty of mountains:

----

Back home for one day, I packed my stuff to get back to Switzerland only one day later. I had the pleasure to speak at the Swiss Publishing Days in Winterthur near Zurich.

Only a few days later, I was on my way to Bologna (by train) to head to From The Front conference which is super lovely each time.

![Bologna seen from the top](http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3788/10105341415_707a4a9ac6_b.jpg)

This time I added four more days to the Italy trip so I could explore a bit of Italy. I first went to Manarola, a very beautiful place in Cinque Terre. I enjoyed the last bits of summer by sitting at the coast, visiting the area and trying out Sea-Kayaking.

Then, for one day, I went to Florence, which is also a very nice city I enjoyed much during this short stay.

2013 has really been an eye-opener to me. I changed lot of my habits to work, to life and to think. I have written down some parts of these changes, and while they may not work for you, here is the list of articles:

- [Working on the Road](http://helloanselm.com/2013/working-on-the-road/)
- [How Sharing is Part of my Job](https://medium.com/lessons-learned/aca10dead168)
- [The Value and Importance of Content](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/anselm-hannemann/2013-october-3)
- Live with less things, donate what you don’t need. I cleared my book shelf and spend them to people who needed them.
- Sport and Outdoor activities are really important to me.
- Take it easy.

----

In October I went to Nuremberg for the **border:none** conference which was a small event hosted by Marc Thiele and Joschi Kuphal. It was super cool but also the very first ODL Admin Meetup took place the day after which for me personally was a very important day as we could discuss how Open Device Labs can work, how they should work and how we could help each other with the ODLs.

The day before the conference I went bouldering with [Dirk](https://twitter.com/faulancr):

----

In Munich, I spoke at the WebTechCon 2013 about “[We’re not There Yet](http://slidedeck.io/anselmh/webtechcon-13--we-are-not-there-yet)”.

Days later, I gave a slightly modified but similar talk at the super cool MODxPO EU 2013 in Cologne. It was really a pleasure to speak to all the attendees there.
[![Me on stage at MODXpo Conference](http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2859/10724169735_9efa6fe565_b.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jaygilmore/10724169735/sizes/l/in/faves-smooth-graphics/)

----

When I came back from Cologne, my colleagues and me moved to a new office space in Munich. The new bureau is much bigger than the old one and so much nicer that I enjoy being there all the time since we moved there.

----

On November, 20th Hans-Christian and me finally launched the **[INIT Project](http://helloanselm.com/2013/introducing-init/)** which is a Front-End Framework to help you using a solid and good workflow.

Only days later, my first official polyfill—the [CSS `object-fit` Polyfill](http://helloanselm.com/2013/fix-image-resizing-with-object-fit/)—went live with the massive help by Christian Schäfer.

----

In December I again went to Düsseldorf for the Play & Make Conference which gave me much inspiration and had super awesome talks.

# 2014

Last but not least, some news: Starting in January I will move to Cologne for around six months. There is a new job waiting for me with some cool people and new challenges and I am happily awaiting to live in another city for half a year. If you’re near Cologne, send me a message.

## I want to do better

Surely there are things I want to improve in the new year. 2013 was awesome, I managed to improve my work-life balance a lot and cannot complain what I achieved. But without improvement it would be boring so I have the following plan:

- Travel to new places (maybe outside Europe)
- Do different conferences than the usual ones I attended several times now
- Improve time management for my work
- Improve JavaScript skills
- Speak at conferences again
- Work on my project ideas finally
- Do more sport

Wish you all the best and a good start into 2014!<br>
Anselm
