## Beyondtellerand Conference

The last week was a special week for me. First, the awesome (and probably best web conference I know of) [beyondtellerand 2013](http://2013.beyondtellerrand.com/) took place. I met a lot of new people and had a great time enjoying all the well chosen speakers.

The second day was something special for me – my first SmashingMag article was published this day.

## Open Device Labs &ndash; Why Should We Care?

On Tuesday, May 28th 2013 [my first **Smashing Magazine** article](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/05/28/open-device-labs-why-should-we-care/) came out. It is a general introduction into Device Testing on Real Devices and the possibility to save costs by crowdsourcing devices in shared places around the world – so called Open Device Labs.

If you have thoughts about it, please share them as comments on the article and I'd be happy if you share the article to spread the word about Open Device Labs!

## netawards

On Friday, May 31th 2013 I flew to London early in the morning to participate the .netmag **[netawards](http://www.thenetawards.com/) 2013**. I was nominated with the **[opendevicelab.com](http://opendevicelab.com/) project** as Game Changer Of The Year together with Christian "The Schepp" Schäfer and Jay Meissner. We are still super excited about the nomination itself. We didn't won the award but appreciate all support and help! I also met many new people from the web scene and had good conversations and a great time!
