title: "Should conference coverage be free for everyone?"
---

**Recently I often had discussion wether conference video coverage should be available for free regardless one attended to the conference or not. Time to ask you!**

I would be pleased if you spread the word and share this post. I want to make a real survey here with enough votes to be representative for everyone. Until now I received by far not enough votes yet.

**When I reach at least 1000 votes, I will evaluate and share the results in public**. I want to achieve that conference organizers know what their audience think about it. And I want happier attendees on every conference! :)
