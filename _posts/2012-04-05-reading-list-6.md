title: "[Weekly Roundup #6] Responsiveness & jQuery things"
---

**My favorite links from the past days. This week most are about reponsive design and jQuery**

## Let's talk about useful jQuery scripts:

- a jQuery plugin that makes it easy to share and demo code in-page, using GitHub gists:   
[Intelligist](http://srobbin.com/jquery-plugins/intelligist/)

- Rodney Rehm wrote a blog post about hooks in jQuery. A very interesting but probably unknown thing – so just read what you can do with jQuery hooks:  
[jQuery Hooks](http://blog.rodneyrehm.de/archives/11-jQuery-Hooks.html)

- Envision is a javascript to create visualizations for live-charts. It looks very promising for stock live charts e.g.:

- Javascript/CSS3 title attribute styling with this simple snippet from Christian Schäfer ([@derSchepp](https://twitter.com/#!/derSchepp)) (fix by Rodney Rehm):

## Responsiveness enhanced with CSS3

- A CSS3 only slider. Nothing new but using quite good markup and simple CSS3 to do this. Unfortunately not fluid but still worth a try? Or maybe I should have published my slider I've written some months ago, looks like it's basically the same… ;)

- A horizontal CSS3-media-query driven layout which switches to a vertical on small devices. Nice showcase and maybe it's a inspiration for your next layout?

- Responsive content navigator is a tutorial also from typomanus.net showing a content navigator using CSS3 only. This is something cool but I'm not convinced if it's the right way to go because you don't have URI's in there.

## Searching for the right gift?

- Here's a non-development link which I think could be useful to you. Search for a gift fitting to the friend (you have to answer a few questions about him/her and get a list of fitting gifts). Very cool!

## Now get to business!

- Google posted a video yesterday with smart glasses. Supercool, just watch!
