**Freshly recovered from one week of holidays I now catch up the latest things happened between Christmas and now. And as usual I am again a bit late with the list.**

- Ooh, that is a harsh title. But Yoav Weiss knows what he's talking about when he says: **[Bandwidth media queries we don't need them](http://mobile.smashingmagazine.com/2013/01/09/bandwidth-media-queries-we-dont-need-em/)**

- Bryan Jones introduced its own **HTML preprocessor in CodeKit 1.4**. This means you now can use variables in HTML using the [.kit file format](http://incident57.com/codekit/kit.php). Holy shit this is what we want!

- PPK published a huge article about **[implementation of CSS gradients](http://www.quirksmode.org/css/images/) in the User Agents** 

- jng5 released the first version of her supercool responsive email boilerplate. This is incredibly useful! Check out **[Antwort](http://internations.github.com/antwort/)**

- Monotype released its new product called **[Skyfonts](https://skyfonts.com/)**. An app that let's you rent fonts for a specific time frame. We finally have a good product again for fonts. The good: That makes it cheap to buy a font for client-work.

- **[Web Performance Crash Course](http://www.igvita.com/slides/2012/webperf-crash-course.pdf)** - PDF slides about basics of web performance optimization techniques.

- You wondered about how to deal with lightboxes on mobile? This is a hard one but Brad Frost has an answer in his project **[Conditional Lightbox](http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/conditional-lightbox/)**
