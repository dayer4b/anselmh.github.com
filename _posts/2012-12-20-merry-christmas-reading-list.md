title: "Merry Christmas andâ€¦ a Reading List"
---


**This will be the last Reading List for this year and at that time also a space for some announcements. Unless tomorrow world explodes, 2013 will be an awesome year!**

## Holidays

First, I will be in holidays for the next few days and back on January, 6th.  
Don't expect an answer or anything else via email, twitter oder other communication. I won't have access to phone or internet during this time.

## Projects

Second, there will be an awesome project launching very soon and be sure you don't miss anything. To do so, **follow [@labuporg on twitter](https://twitter.com/labuporg) or [@klick_ass](https://twitter.com/klick_ass) and [@derSchepp](https://twitter.com/derSchepp)**.

Also I will start working on a project which is for one of the biggest IT software company in Europe. It will be a fully responsive website or call it interactive online magazine for their data center.

## Conferences

Don't think I will stop going to conferences. Here is my planned list you also can see on [lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/profile/anselmhannemann/future/):

- I will speak at **[TakeOff Conference](http://takeoffconf.com/)** in Lille together with [@drublic](https://twitter.com/drublic), [@rodneyrehm](https://twitter.com/rodneyrehm), [@asciidisco](https://twitter.com/asciidisco).

- I will speak at [FOGRA Digital Publishing Symposium](http://www.fogra.org/fogra-veranstaltungen/schulungen/dps-deu/) in Munich

- I will host the **[PUBKON 2013](http://2013.pubkon.eu/)** in Berlin on April, 18th-20th. You can save a early bird ticket now and support my conference

And I will attend to many other conferences. To keep up, see my lanyrd profile.

## Christmas Reading List

- WHATWG [works on **sortable tables**](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/temp). A huge step here!

- An **[interactive Guide to Blog Typography](http://www.kaikkonendesign.fi/typography/)** - simply well done.

- **[HTML5Bones](http://html5bones.com/)** by Ian Devlin is a super simplified HTML framework without all those libraries you probably don't need.

- **[Vexing Viewports](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/vexing-viewports/)** is an article you should read to better understand how pixels, User Agents and device-screens work (together).

- [&lt;main&gt;-element is coming!](http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-html-main-element-20121217/)

- Steve Souders on **[What makes a good blog post](http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2012/12/14/a-good-blog-post/)**

Now there is only one thing to do:

## Merry Christmas and a happy new year!
