## Events

See [my appearances at Conferences](/conf/) where I have spoken or will speak at.

### [NightlyBuild.io Conference](http://www.nightlybuild.io/)

Together with four other people I create and organized the after-work front-end development conference NightlyBuild.io in 2014. It has been sold out within less than four weeks and featured six great international speakers.

While not publicly announced yet, we will continue working on this event in 2015.

### [PUBKON Conference](http://pubkon.eu/)

The PUBKON conference is a German publishing event happening each year since 2012. It features mostly high-level speakers but also some less known new talents and full day workshops the day before the conference starts. I am one of three organizers.

### [InDesign User Group Munich](http://indesignusergroup.de/)

I was co-host of the InDesign User Group Munich for five years. Events happen every two months and are free and public.
