## Projects

		<h3>Book: Adobe Digital Publishing Suite</h3>
		<p>Together with <a href="https://twitter.com/richardbrammer">Richard Brammer</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/FischaelaMeer">Michaela Lehr</a> from Berlin I wrote my first book. It has been published at the dpunkt Verlag and currently is available in German. A digital English version is planned and might be released in fall 2013.</p>

		<h3>SAP Data Center Frontend</h3>

		<h3>FOCUS Magazin for iPad</h3>
		<p>Together with <a href="http://2issue.com/">2issue</a> digital publishing gmbh I created the FOCUS Magazine for iPad in Germany. My job was the technical research, technical setup, scripting (automatisation of layout conversion) and technical project management and development. Together with 2issue I researched and created a nice, clean and good readable layout for tablet devices.</p>

		<h3>MONTE Magazin for iPad</h3>
		<p>I developed one of the first iPad Magazines at mag10 together with <a href="http://2issue.com/">2issue</a>. This included coding a social sharing service for the iPad magazine including an analytics service.
