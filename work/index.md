Here are some projects I am part of. For most I developed the frontend code or did the design.

## Projects

<ul class="work">
	<li>
		<h3>NightlyBuild.io Website</h3>
		<p>This conference website is written in plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript—optimized in a post-processing step to serve it to the user. It makes use of the CSS-Flexbox technology, parallax scrolling and other cool stuff.</p>

		<h3>SAP Data Center Frontend</h3>
		<p>I hand-crafted the frontend of the new SAP Data Center website together with <a href="http://drublic.de/">Hans-Christian Reinl</a>. It uses semantic, well structured and performant HTML5, CSS3 and  JavaScript to gain full performance even on mobile devices.</p>

		<h3>FOCUS Magazin Teaser Website</h3>

## Events

Together with four other people I create and organized the after-work front-end development conference NightlyBuild.io in 2014. It has been sold out within less than four weeks and featured six great international speakers.

The PUBKON conference is a German publishing event happening once a year. It features most of the top-speakers as well as some less known newcomers and full day workshops the day before the conference starts. I am one of  three organizers.
