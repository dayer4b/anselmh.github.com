## Events

See [my appearances at Conferences](/conf/) where I have spoken or will speak at.

### [NightlyBuild.io Conference](http://www.nightlybuild.io/)

Together with four other people I create and organized the after-work front-end development conference NightlyBuild.io in 2014. It has been sold out within less than four weeks and featured six great international speakers.

### [PUBKON Conference](http://pubkon.eu/)

The PUBKON conference is a German publishing event happening once a year. It features most of the top-speakers as well as some less known newcomers and full day workshops the day before the conference starts. I am one of  three organizers.

### [InDesign User Group Munich](http://indesignusergroup.de/)

I am one of three hosts of the InDesign User Group Munich. Events happen every two months and are free and public.
