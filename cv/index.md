### For inquiries please consider:

- Both, me and you probably want to have a good product when you hire me. The groundwork for this is a proper, realistic timeframe and project management. Nothing is worse than a project with countless revisions and changes not being finished, mostly for your customer. If you need help with project management or methodology how to plan your project, I’m happy to help you out or point you to the right person.

- Plan ahead. Projects can only be well crafted with a proper timeframe. To do my work the project’s goal, a concept and at least a rough design (if not also required) and technical setup should be already defined and set. If you need help or don’t know what you need to do, please contact me in advance so we can figure this out before starting the project.
