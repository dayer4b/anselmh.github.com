## "Open work"

I believe in Open Source and sharing resources with other people. Although I cannot open source every piece of work I do, I try to do my best improving the web and sharing resources to the community. I try to move the web forward by [contributing code](http://github.com/anselmh/), writing articles or speaking at conferences or talking in podcasts.

Here are a few projects I do:

- [W3C Responsive Images CG](http://responsiveimages.org/) is the platform for a native W3C responsive images solution. It contains the latest specifications for W3C, demo-data, use-case documents and much more.

- [opendevicelab.com](http://opendevicelab.com/) is a platform that shows you all OpenDeviceLabs around the world and tells you how to use or maintain it.

- [CSS-Slider](http://helloanselm.com/css-slider/)

- [Web Dev Reading List](http://wdrl.helloanselm.com/)

- Core-Contributor to [CSS-Modal](http://drublic.github.io/css-modal/) and [init](https://github.com/drublic/init)

- Documenting the web [@webplatform](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/User:Anselm), [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/profiles/anselmh) and [W3C Testing Suite](http://test.csswg.org/).

- Discussing specifications and use-cases in W3C and WHATWG Mailing Lists.

- Write articles in magazines or on websites with useful content:
