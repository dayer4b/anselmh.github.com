====================

My personal website and blog.

## Used techniques:

- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
- [github pages](http://pages.github.com/)
- [HTML5Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) through a customized build of [init](https://github.com/drublic/init)
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)

## Read my code and learn

I build the blog on github to let you learn from it. Feel free to fork the repository, try to modify it or whatever you wish. The only restriction is, you cannot use a copy or only slightly modified version commercially. For that, please ask me and I will see what we can do about this.

If you find a bug, [report it here](https://github.com/anselmh/anselmh.github.com/issues) or even better, edit and send a pull-request with the fix.

## No comments?

Yes, there will be no comments on my blog. Some people show how this could work on Jekyll pages but I am not a friend of comments in blog posts. If you want to say something about it, do it on [twitter](https://twitter.com/helloanselm), [app.net](https://alpha.app.net/anselm) or [Google Plus](https://plus.google.com/111125333979619018462/posts).
