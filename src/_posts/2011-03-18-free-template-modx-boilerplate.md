<p><strong>„<a href="https://github.com/anselmh/modx-boilerplate">MODX Boilerplate</a>“</strong> is a <strong>free HTML5-template</strong> for rapid website development with the <strong>MODX Evolution &amp; Revolution CMF</strong>. It's based on the widely-used HTML5Boilerplate but contains some additional scripts for increased performance as well as some code-snipptes for common usage.</p>
<p><strong>Notice: </strong>This template is only a raw HTML/CSS/JS-Framework. There's no layout in it to sustain the flexibility as MODX itself does. This framework is thought to help you creating a technically correct HTML5 website with backwards compatibility for older browsers. It's up to you what layout or techniques you want to use for your website.</p>

<h2>Contents of the package</h2>
<p>Due to the fact it's been created only for MODX and based on the HTML5Boilerplate, we use their file structures. We created the MODX assets structure for the template and preserved the Boilerplate folder structure inside. This is best practice even for new MODX users who don't know the whole structure.</p>
<p>Our package includes the following files:</p>

- **HTML5Boilerplate**: Structure (part.), HTML-Code (part.), etc.
- **Modernizr**: HTML5-Modernizr. For adding better HTML5 support to specific webbrowsers</li>
- **jQuery**: latest build of jQuery library used min.</li>
- **MODX Chunks + Template**: The HTML parts are split into 3 files you should use in MODX Manager (Chunk for header and footer, template with chunk calls for content)</li>
- **CSS files**: Some CSS files are served, too. They provide basic settings as a CSS reset. They do not affect layout in a bad way.
- **Dead Simple Grid**: you can also use another css-file with the Dead simple grid system integrated. Features media-queries and dynamic layout.

<h2>Upcoming</h2>
<p>There will be some changes in future releases to get the package more flexible and powerful. See new releases on <a href="https://github.com/anselmh/modx-boilerplate">GitHub</a>.</p>
