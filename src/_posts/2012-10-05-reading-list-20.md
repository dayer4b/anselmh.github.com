**After being on several conferences the last days I have some new links for you this week.**

- The first is about the **[Adobe Create The Web tour](http://klick-ass.com/events/the-modern-web-needs-modern-tools-create-the-web-london/)** where I actually was in London this Monday.

- The netmagazine just published an article where **[devs respond to Adobe edge Suite](http://www.netmagazine.com/features/devs-respond-adobe-edge-suite)** and state what's cool.

- This is fresh stuff. Just today Phil Hawksworth held his talk **"[I can smell your CMS](https://speakerdeck.com/u/philhawksworth/p/i-can-smell-your-cms)"** at the Fronteers Conference 2012.

- Chris Heilmann just advertised this little tool at Fronteers: **[MaKey MaKey](http://www.makeymakey.com/)** is a little keyboard extension with which you can do some awesome stuff!

- Hixie has this cool tool: **[Live DOM viewer](http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/)** just gives you the DOM nodes of your markup live in the browser.

- Here is a list of **[events by the W3C](http://www.w3.org/participate/eventscal.html)**

And by the way: If you wanna go to a conference this year in Germany I have two tipps for you.

- Marc Thiele just do this absolutely awesome **[beyondtellerand](http://2012.beyondtellerrand.com/)** conference. It's a frontend and design conference taking place in DÃ¼sseldorf in November 2012.

- In Munich, the **[push.conference](http://push-conference.com/2012/)** is a great option to get some inspiration about design.
