## I speak

I speak at conferences about frontend cutting-edge technologies.    

If you search for speakers or workshop leaders and organize an event, do not hesitate to contact me. I will research about your event and generally like to be part of it but if I think I don't fit to the audience I will say so. Don't be upset by this – I just think the audience should get the best speakers they could get about the specific topic. I am happy to recommend some colleagues if that applies.

## I organize

I am host of several smaller events and organize a conference called ["PUBKON"]() – a German publishing event where about 250 people of the industry are part of it including the top speakers in industry.  
I also organize several smaller events like the [IDUG Munich]() series.
