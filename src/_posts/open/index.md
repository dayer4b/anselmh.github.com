## "Open work"

I believe in Open Source and sharing resources with other people. Although I cannot open source every piece of work I do, I try to do my best improving the web and sharing resources to the community.  
Here are a few projects I do:

- [W3C Responsive Images CG]()

- [opendevicelab.com](http://opendevicelab.com/) is a platform that shows you all OpenDeviceLabs around the world and tells you how to use or maintain it.

- Documenting the web [@webplatform](), [MDN]() and [W3C Testing Suite](http://test.csswg.org/)

- Discussing specifications and use-cases in W3C and WHATWG Mailing Lists.

- Write articles in magazines or on websites with useful content. 

- MLReader, MODX-Boilerplate, HTML5-DPS-Boilerplate, Publishing-Please!
