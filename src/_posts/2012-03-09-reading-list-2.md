title: "[Weekly Roundup] Links & Technologies #2"
---

**This weeks hot projects and links about web-technology, digital publishing and other inspiring stuff.**

I'll start with a personal concern &ndash; responsive images. Matthew Wilcox is one of the active members of the responsive images working group in the W3C where I am part of, too.  
But we recently experienced many problems which are explained on his blog:  

- [Impending problems with authoring responsive designs](http://mattwilcox.net/archive/entry/id/1081/)


And now my other suggestions for this week:


- A Slideshare presentation **summarizing mobile / responsive website problems**:  
[Muddling through the mobile web](http://www.slideshare.net/yiibu/muddling-through-the-mobile-web/)

- [**Thinking async**](http://css-tricks.com/thinking-async/)

- Adobe just released a **new tool called "Shadow"**. It's a web-developer tool to **remote inspect websites on smartphones or other devices** through weinre and Google Chrome. A first tutorial is [available here](http://corlan.org/2012/03/07/introducing-adobe-shadow-a-new-way-to-debug-mobile-web-sites-and-apps/) or [one in German](http://uiux.de/artikel/adobe-shadow).
