title: "I am a high performance blog"

**With my new layout I have a high performance web blog now. With just a hand full of requests and nearly now assets it is super fast.**

Roundup:

- removed typekit (saves nearly ~250kb) and ~8 requests, using "Helvetica Neue"
- removed unnecessary content (social blabla)
- removed comments
- removed all images (except content images on blog entries)

Now I have a blog using 9.81kb of space, 5 requests and a DOMonload @637ms (from same country as server). Awesome, right? Share your comments on [Google Plus](https://plus.google.com/111125333979619018462/posts/6XJCtXAM8KN).
