title: "Can I update to Apple Mountain Lion with Adobe CS6?"
---

**Many people feared it and love it: The point when Apple releases its new OS. It always is the same game, you don't really know if Adobe apps would work fine on the system after upgrading.**

I installed **Mountain Lion** which took me 45mins including download. Sorry, I've got FTTH here and downloading such large files is fun and my SSD installed the system in about 15min.

Now to the facts:

- OS X Mountain Lion works great here.
- Adobe InDesign CS6 works.
- Adobe InDesign CS5.5 works.
- Adobe Illustrator CS6 works.
- Adobe Premiere CS6 works.
- Adobe After Effects CS6 works.
- Adobe Media Encoder CS6 works.
- Adobe Bridge CS6 works.
- Adobe Photoshop CS6 works.
- Adobe Dreamweaver CS6 works.
- Adobe Edge works.

Some other maybe helpful Apps that work:

- TweetBot (had one crash but it is in Alpha, so hey)
- Sparrow Mail
- Skype
- Firefox, Chrome
- Reflection 1.4 (update through App's own update mechanism to latest build!)
- ImageOptim
- Coda2
- Transmit
- Microsoft Office 2011

_Now some additional info: This tests are personal tests on my machine which is a MacBook Air 2011. I also tested with my MacBook Pro 15" (Mid 2012) and an external CinemaDisplay (via DisplayPort, not Thunderbolt). I cannot guarantee that this is working on your machine, too, but hope that this helps you. If you find wrong information or a bug, please notify me!_

## UPDATE

Some issues have been reported when using Adobe CS6 with a beamer (VGA) and MacBookPro 13" (late 2011). I cannot confirm crashes but you maybe should test it before your next presentation.
