Hey!

If you want to hire me, you might want to go to my [»work with me« page](/hire/) first. <br>
Get in touch with me if you want to talk with me about a project, working together, or if you want me to speak at a conference or want me to do a worksop. Please bear in mind [my few but important guidelines](/about/#matchmyinterest), so both of us will have a great time working together.

## Availability

I am currently accepting new projects starting **August, 2014**.

Cheers!<br>
-Anselm
