## Hey!

If you want to hire me, you might want to go to my [CV](/cv/) or [About page](/about/). <br>
Get in touch with me if you want to talk with me about a project, working together, or if you want me to speak at a conference or want me to do a worksop. Please bear in mind [my few but important guidelines](/about/), so both of us will have a great time working together.

## Get in touch with me
