## Hey!

If you want to hire me, you might want to go to my [»work with me« page](/hire/) first. <br>
Get in touch with me if you want to talk with me about a project, working together, or if you want me to speak at a conference or want me to do a worksop. Please bear in mind [my few but important guidelines](/about/#matchmyinterest), so both of us will have a great time working together.

## Availability

I am currently accepting new projects starting **October, 2014**.

<a class="btn--big--positive" href="mailto:hello@anselm-hannemann.com?subject=Let's talk">Get in touch with me!</a>

_(If possible, encrypt your e-mail with PGP. [My Public Key is to be found here](https://anselm.taurus.uberspace.de/1BE74300.asc))_

Cheers!<br>
-Anselm
