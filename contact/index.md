Hey,

it seems you want to contact me. If you want to hire me, you might want to go to my [»work with me« page](/hire/). <br>
Please get in touch with me if you want to talk with me about a project, about working together, want me to speak at a conference or want me to do a worksop. Please bear in mind [my few but important guidelines](/about/#matchmyinterest), so both of us will have a great time working together.

## Availability

I am currently accepting new projects starting **July, 2014**.

<a class="btn--big--positive" href="mailto:hello@anselm-hannemann.com?subject=Let's work together">Get in touch with me!</a>

Cheers!<br>
-Anselm
