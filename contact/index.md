Hi,

it seems you want to contact me. That is lovely and I'd like to speak to you but first ensure [you meet my guidelines](/about/#matchmyinterest) and [notices for Recruiters](/about/#recruiters).
This is for both, your and my happiness :-)

Now if you are still interested, please send an **e-mail** to [hello@anselm-hannemann.com](mailto:hello@anselm-hannemann.com).

<h2 class="page--notice">Notice: I am in vacation from March, 27th to April, 7th. I won't be able to respond to any email during this time and will catch up after my holidays.</h2>

You can also try to call me via mobile at +49 172 . 263 97 09 but most of the time it is safer and easier to first send me an e-mail before talking via phone.

Now I'd love to hear from you!
-Anselm
