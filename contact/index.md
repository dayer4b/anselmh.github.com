## Hey!

If you want to hire me, you might want to go to my [CV](/cv/) or [About page](/about/). <br>
Get in touch with me if you want to talk with me about a project, working together, or if you want me to speak at a conference or want me to do a worksop. Please bear in mind [my few but important guidelines](/about/), so both of us will have a great time working together.

## Availability

I am currently accepting new projects starting **February, 2015** (limited capacity).

<a class="btn--big--positive" href="mailto:hello@helloanselm.com?subject=I%20came%20across%20your%20website%20and%20wanted%20to%20talk%20to%20you">Get in touch with me!</a>

_(If possible, encrypt your e-mail with PGP. [My Public Key is to be found here](https://anselm.taurus.uberspace.de/1BE74300.asc))_

Cheers!<br>
-Anselm
